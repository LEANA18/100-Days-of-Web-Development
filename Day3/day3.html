    <p id="para1">Earth, our home planet, is the third planet from the Sun, and the fifth largest planet. It's the only place we know of inhabited by living things.</p>
    <p id="para2">While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface.</p>
    <h4 class="content">Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life abundant here. Most notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered in liquid water, since the temperature allows liquid water to exist for extended periods of time. Earth's vast oceans provided a convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.</h4>
    <h3 class="content">Some of the features of our planet that make it great for sustaining life are changing due to the ongoing effects of climate change.</h3>

        <p class="colors">Earth is the only planet that has a single moon. Our Moon is the brightest and most familiar object in the night sky. In many ways, the Moon is responsible for making Earth such a great home. It stabilizes our planet's wobble, which has made the climate less variable over thousands of years.</p>
